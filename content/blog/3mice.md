In blog post _"An Eye for Nature"_ we looked at artificial retina solutions for degenerative conditions like AMD that are common cause of blindness in humans. As a follow up I would like to mention a [2019 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09124-x) which offers an amazingly simple potential treatment for such retinal damge.

The authors noted that, whilst the [opsins](https://www.chemistryworld.com/podcasts/opsins/6108.article), the protein part of light-sensitive receptors found in the [rod and cone cells](https://www.easybiologyclass.com/difference-between-rod-cells-and-cone-cells-comparison-table) of the human retina, are normally embedded in the molecular complex of the [G-protein-coupled-receptor signalling cascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor) that amplifies and moderates (through feedback loops) the signal from the photoreceptive pigments, these complexes are common to many kinds of cells not just rods and cones. They were also aware that although the rods and cones are lost in many retinal degenerative diseases, the main nerve cells of the retina, the [retinal ganglion cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_ganglion_cell), are not lost and remain active albeit insensitive to light. Putting these two facts together led them to ask the question, if we put the genes coding for a retinal photoreceptor into retinal ganglion cells might the opsins automatically integrate into the ganglions' G-protein signalling complexes, without the need to somehow transplant the entire opsin-signalling complex? To address this they used an [Adeno-Associated Virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adeno-associated_virus) (AAV) to carry the gene coding for green cone cell opsin into the genome of the retinal ganglion cells of blind mice. Although many neuroscientists would have said that this simple approach should not work, the experiment did in fact work. The blind mice were not only able to pass several of the tests used in humans to test eyesight (and were almost indistiguishable from normal mice in such tests), but their transformed ganglia even adjusted the photo-response according to the light level, turning the signal up in low light and down in bright light!

Although the findings appear miraculous, there is some way to go before this technique can be used to treat people. Although the AAV used specifically infects retinal ganglion cells, and so can be precisely targeted, there are issues of [insertional mutagenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertional_mutagenesis) because the viral genome can insert itself into the cells' genomes at random positions (this can potentially cause cancer or loss of essential gene function—for more on this see [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5758940/)). The authors note that because the human eye contains thousands of times more ganglion cells than that of the mouse, much larger doses of AAV would be needed to treat a human. Nevertheless, AAV vectors have been FDA approved for use in human degenerative retinal conditions in cases where there is alternative treatment. The treatment might not be suitable for treatment of all retinal degenerative diseases because the retinal ganglion cells do not survive in all such conditions. In _[retinitis pigmentosa]_(https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/eye-conditions/retinitis-pigmentosa), the target disease of these authors, 30% to 75% of these cells survive relative to normal eyes (for details see [this paper](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2162046), whereas in wet AMD over half of the cells are lost. In dry AMD the approach is most promising as cell survival in this case is as good as in normal eyes (for more see [this paper](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2123592)); however, we need to consider that these cells are also lost with ageing and the conditions to be treated are mostly those of old age. Nevertheless, the finding has great potential in the treatment of retinal degenerative disease.
