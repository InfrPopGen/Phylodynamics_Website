**Retinal degenerative disorders**, such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration ([AMD](https://www.macularsociety.org/age-related-macular-degeneration)), affect millions of people around the world. In the UK alone, AMD is the main cause of loss of sight, affecting over 600,000 people. In all of these disorders, the photoreceptor cells lining the retina at the back of the eye lose function, which leads to the loss of sight. Available treatments are at best capable of only slowing the degeneration in some individuals. The devastating impact of these disorders on human wellbeing and the lack of a cure have prompted researchers to seek radical solutions to the problem. The idea they came up with was to replace the damaged retina with an artificial one, and the development of such ‘bionic’ eyes has exploded into a wide range of devices and systems. The US Department of Energy even ran its own [Artificial Retina Project](https://science.energy.gov/ber/research/bssd/artificial-retina/) leading to the first clinical trial [Argus I](https://www.2-sight.com/history-en.html) in 2002 in which six patients received ‘bionic’ eye implants. By 2006, trials of the [Argos II](https://www.artificialretina.energy.gov/about.shtml) device had been carried out in 30 patients across Europe and the United States. By 2011 the device was approved for clinical use in Europe and by 2013 70 people had received these implants. Unfortunately, these retinal prosthetics use arrays of electrodes or photodiodes to convey small pulses of electricity to mimic the action of the lost retinal cells by stimulating the nerves of the retina; they are therefore limited by the density of photoreceptors and by the weight and bulk of the materials used. Consequently, these implants generate very low resolution images and are of benefit only to those with extensive sight loss.

Fortunately, a team at the University of Oxford’s [Department of Chemistry](http://research.chem.ox.ac.uk/hagan-bayley.aspx), and led by Dphil student [Vanessa Restrepo-Schild](http://bayley.chem.ox.ac.uk/vrestreposchild/) stepped in with an innovative solution to many of the problems faced by these ‘digital camera’ style implants. Restrepo-Schild realised that the scarring and inflammation caused by such devices, which limited their utility, could be avoided by building a retina out of biological materials―using only materials that occur naturally in the eye. Consequently she set about building a photosensitive array similar to that of the retina from materials normally used in cell culture. The resulting implant would be not only less inflammatory, but also more soft and flexible to mimic better the original retina. Vanessa Restrepo-Schild realised that the [hydrogels](https://www.sciencealert.com/this-stretchy-drug-delivering-gel-could-be-the-band-aid-of-the-future) normally used in the laboratory had the right strength and flexibility for the job, but the team developed their own tailored gel for the purpose.

To emulate the light response function of the retina, they developed what they called ‘synthetic cells’, which were produced by arranging water droplets on the hydrogel in a lipid-containing oil. A lipid bilayer then formed naturally around each droplet, creating a ‘synthetic cell’. The cells were made photosensitive by adding the light-driven proton pump, [bacteriorhodopsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriorhodopsin), to the water droplets. In addition to flexibility and compatibility, the tiny water droplets can achieve arrays with greater pixel density than the ‘digital camera’ style devices. The approach is particularly neat because, as Restrepo-Schild points out, their synthetic retina already speaks the same language as the underlying nerve cells, and so should generate electrical impulses exactly as the real retina would. The impulses, when passed to the brain, are likely to be interpreted more readily as natural sight. Restrepo-Schild’s next step is to create, in fact print on their lab’s bespoke 3D printer, a 3D version of the device and observe how it communicates with nerve cells in tissue culture. The team is confident that they will soon have a system able to not only recognise colours, but also shapes and patterns, prior to preclinical testing and then clinical trials.

Restrepo-Schild cites her childhood fascination with the difference between the living and the machine as the source of her inspiration. She has long been pondering the idea of using parts of our own living bodies in devices that would not themselves be living, but would function as in vivo. We at Bang! are thankful that her childhood interests never faded, and rather proud that this potentially life changing research was done here, in Oxford.
