I am a researcher with the [evolve.zoo lab](http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Evolve/Home.html) in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford. My current research interests include cancer phylodynamics, pathogen population genetics, spatial genetics, and host-pathogen evolutionary relationships. Related interests include bioinformatics, oncology, and applications in translational medicine. I am currently supported by the European Union's [European Research Council](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) FP7 Ideas programme.

Prior to moving to Oxford I was based at the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/stephen-attwood.html) in London working on the parasitic blood-fluke _Schistosoma_. During this time I undertook many field expeditions, leading teams in remote areas of Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia. I later moved my focus to China, working on the Schistosomiasis Control Programme there. My parasitological work resulted in the discovery and naming of several new species and insights into the health and biodiversity [impacts of hydro-power dams](https://www.dw.com/en/a-dam-building-race-threatens-the-mekong-river/a-50049206) in the Mekong Basin. I identified two new foci of schistosomiasis transmission to humans in Cambodia and Laos, greatly expanding the [risk-map for Mekong schistosomiasis](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-03/plos-msi031408.php) and was the first to report the transmission of this disease outside the Mekong river.

I began my postdoctoral career as an NERC Fellow, following this I was PI on three Project grants awarded to me by the Wellcome Trust. I also held a China National Science Foundation Project Grant, and numerous small awards. I have taught Molecular Ecology at [West China Medical School](https://www.healthcareglobal.com/top10/top-10-largest-hospitals-world), and for a short time as a visitor at Kingston University (London).
