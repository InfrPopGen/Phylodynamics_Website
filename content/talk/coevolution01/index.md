abstract: "_Schistosoma japonicum_ causes major public health problems in China and the Philippines; this parasite, which is transmitted by freshwater snails of the species _Oncomelania hupensis_, causes the disease intestinal schistosomiasis in humans and cattle. Researchers working on _Schistosoma_ in Africa have described the relationship between the parasites and their snail intermediate hosts as coevolved or even as an evolutionary arms race. In this talk such an hypothesis of coevolution is evaluated for _S. japonicum_ and _O. hupensis_. The origins and radiation of the snails and the parasite across China, and the taxonomic validity of the sub-species of O. hupensis, are also discussed."
