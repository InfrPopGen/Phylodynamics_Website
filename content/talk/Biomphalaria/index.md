abstract: "The South American freshwater snail _Biomphalaria_ has been reorted from Guangdong Province in southern China. The introduction of snails of this genus to China is of importance because several species are involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis to humans in South America and Africa. Although human schistosomiasis is endemic in China, the species involved is different and the introduction of schistosomiasis transmitted by _Biomphalaria_  would allow transmission to a greater population and in new habitats across southern China. Population phylogenetics has been used to identify the species involved, assess the relationships of populations in China, and estimate their origins and patterns of colonisation. This talk covers current developments in this area and considers the associated additional risk of schistosomiasis posed to China by these snails."
